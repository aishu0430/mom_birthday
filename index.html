For nine precious months, I lived within you, cradled in your warmth, protected in the safest place I would ever know. Your heartbeat was my first lullaby, your voice was my first song, your love was my first home. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

You were a warrior even then, fighting battles I was too small to see, losing things you never speak of, enduring suffering you've never burdened me with. üí™</p>
                    
                    <p>Mom, for those nine months of sacrifice, for every moment of discomfort and pain you endured to bring me into this world‚ÄîI bow down at your feet with tears in my eyes. I am here because you were strong enough to carry me through. I breathe because you chose to fight. I live because you loved me before you even met me. üôè</p>

Through blurred vision and in a world that was strange and new, the first face I saw was yours. And in that moment, everything made sense. üòä</p>
                    
                    <p>You held me like I was the most precious treasure in the universe, your baby princess, your miracle, your answered prayer. From that very first moment, you promised me with your eyes what your heart had already decided: that you would never leave my side, that you would protect me with your life, that your love for me would never waver. üíù</p>

                    <p>Amma, do you know what you gave me that day? Not just life, but a reason to live it. Not just breath, but a purpose to breathe. You became my world, and I became your everything. üåçüíï</p>

You taught me how to walk, but more importantly, you taught me how to rise every time I fell. You fed me, not just with food, but with dreams and courage. You dressed me up not just in beautiful clothes, but in confidence and self-respect. üåà</p>

                    <p>As the years passed and I grew older, life brought its seasons‚Äîsome filled with sunshine and laughter, others heavy with clouds and tears. But through every single season, you remained my constant. My north star. My anchor. My home. ‚öì</p>
                    
                    <p>When I achieved something and my heart burst with joy, you were the first person I wanted to tell. Your proud smile made every victory sweeter, every accomplishment more meaningful. You celebrated my smallest wins as if they were the greatest triumphs. You made me feel like I could conquer the world, simply because you believed in me. üèÜ</p>
                    
                    <p>But it was in my darkest hours that your true strength shone brightest. When life pushed me into shadows, when I felt lost and alone, when pain threatened to consume me‚Äîyou were my light. You didn't just stand by my side; you became my shelter from every storm. üåü</p>

                    <p>There were nights when I cried, and you cried with me‚Äînot because you were weak, but because my pain was your pain. There were days when I felt I couldn't go on, and you carried me on your shoulders, refusing to let me fall. You took my pain as your own, my struggles as your battles. üí™‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
                    
                    <p>You fought for me, Mom, in ways that no one else could see. When the world turned its back on me, you stood between me and everything that tried to hurt me. You were my warrior when I had no strength left to fight. You were my voice when I had no words left to speak. You were my hope when I had nothing left to hold on to.</p>
                    
                    <p>How do I thank you for this, Amma? How do I repay a debt of love that is beyond measure? I cannot. I can only love you with everything I have, for as long as I live. üôèüíï</p>

                    <p>Today, my heart overflows with gratitude not just for you, but for my beloved Tataiah and Ammamma. They raised you, shaped you, and gave our family the most precious gift‚Äîyou. I am blessed beyond measure that they brought such an incredible soul into this world, and that by the grace of God, you became my mother. üå∫</p>

                    <p>People say "mother" is just a word. But to me, it's so much more. Mother is a complete sentence that speaks of unconditional love. Mother is a promise of eternal affection. Mother is the definition of selfless care. Mother is the foundation of trust. üë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶</p>
                    
                    <p>These aren't just concepts I've read about, Mom. These are truths I've lived because of you. You didn't just tell me about love‚Äîyou showed me every single day. üí™üíù</p>
